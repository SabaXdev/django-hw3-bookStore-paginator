Django Bookstore Project

Welcome to the Django Bookstore project! This project is a simple Django application for managing a bookstore. It allows users to view a list of books, see details of each book, and navigate through pages of books.
Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

    Models: Defines the data structure of the application. Currently, there is a single model Book that represents a book in the bookstore.

    Views: Contains the logic to handle HTTP requests and generate responses. There are two views:
        view_of_books: Displays a paginated list of all books available in the bookstore.
        view_of_one_book: Displays the details of a specific book.

    Templates: Contains HTML templates for rendering the user interface. There are two templates:
        all_books.html: Displays the list of books with pagination.
        one_book.html: Displays the details of a single book.
