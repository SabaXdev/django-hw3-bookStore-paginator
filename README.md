# Django Bookstore Project

Welcome to the Django Bookstore project! This project is a simple Django application for managing a bookstore. It allows users to view a list of books, see details of each book, and navigate through pages of books.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

- **Models**: Defines the data structure of the application. Currently, there is a single model `Book` that represents a book in the bookstore.

- **Views**: Contains the logic to handle HTTP requests and generate responses. There are two views:
  - `view_of_books`: Displays a paginated list of all books available in the bookstore.
  - `view_of_one_book`: Displays the details of a specific book.

- **Templates**: Contains HTML templates for rendering the user interface. There are two templates:
  - `all_books.html`: Displays the list of books with pagination.
  - `one_book.html`: Displays the details of a single book.
